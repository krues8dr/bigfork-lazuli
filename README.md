# Big Fork Modpack

This is the official repo for the Big Fork Modpack for Minecraft. It is available to [download on the the Technic platform](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/bigfork.687106).

This pack was previously a light fork of the Big Dig modpack to update the mods to their latest versions. Since then, it's been entirely recreated from scratch, mainly due to the original mods no longer being supported. The current version runs Minecraft 1.12. You can find a list of the mods in the [config file](./lazuli.config.json5).

This repository is a [Lazuli project](https://github.com/krues8dr/lazuli), which you'll need to compile the modpack.
